# ft_printf

**An implementation of the well-known printf function in C, focusing on formatted output, variadic functions, and robust memory handling.**

## Objectives
- Understand and manipulate variadic functions using `va_start`, `va_arg`, and `va_end`.
- Reproduce formatted output for different data types (characters, strings, integers, pointers, hexadecimal, etc.).
- Strengthen parsing logic and string manipulation skills.
- Ensure memory safety and proper error management.

## Skills developed
- Deep experience with variadic functions and format parsing.
- Handling different data types and their representations.
- Improving modularity and maintainability of complex C code.
- Writing efficient and reliable low-level code, compliant with the 42 coding standards.
